# ONE-PAGE
Building a website? Annoyed of changing the menu bar on every single page separately? Just because of one tiny typo? One-Page will help you out: Just focus on the content!

## How does it work?


### Example:
- Goto the folder `pages`.
- Create a new file and name it `mypage.md`.
- Put your content in there.
- Save
- Done, your page is available on `example.com/mypage`!
