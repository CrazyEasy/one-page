# ONE-PAGE
Building a website? Annoyed of changing the menu bar on every single page separately? Just because of one tiny typo? One-Page will help you out: Just focus on the content!

## How does it work?
Making Websites with HTML is out! Now you can simply create your content with MarkDown!

### Example:
- Goto the folder `pages`.
- Create a new file and name it `Example.md`.
